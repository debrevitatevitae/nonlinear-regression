# Nonlinear regression
## Files
- `gd-example.py`: basic use of gradient descent. Data are generated with a 1D function and some Gaussian noise. Later, the parameters are learned with a gradient descent algorithm. The experiment is repeated for different initializations.
- `utils.py`: small library of functions shared between scripts.
